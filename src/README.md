# Introduction

This assignment revolves around the use of gitflow and testing. The main objective of this assignment is to create a software component that stores information about surveys and responses.

This component does not have a user interface or connection to external storage. It only contains a "controller" class with methods that support various features the only way to know if the code successfully works is through a test suite created using JUnit. I followed a Test-Driven development approach when creating this project and each commit contains tests and the appropriate code.

This assignment requires me to also have the following sections :

* A scrum sprint backlog and a estimation of the tasks i wanted to complete

* A section detailing TDD(Test Driven Development) and how I created this project following this methodology.

* A section detailing a code coverage tool that I selected, why I selected it and how I used the tool

* A pull review checklist detailing a number of checks that a reviewer other than myself would make in the process of making pull requests
